# Ecommerce Website Dashboard
*  Analyzed E-commerce website - Created a Sales dashboard using Power BI
* In this, I used different chats Like
  1.  Stacked Column chart
  2.  Stacked Bar chart
  3.  Donut chart
  4.  slicer
  5.  Card

* The Power BI Sales Dashboard provides a visual representation of the data collected from the e-commerce website. The dashboard can be used by the website's owners to track sales trends, identify popular products and categories, and target marketing campaigns.
